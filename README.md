# Algorito - The Telegram Chatbot for Algorithms

**Algorito** is an interactive chatbot designed to help you learn algorithms and programming by integrating two powerful tools: **Gemini** and the **Codeforces API**.

You can find him as **@Algorito_thebot** or by entering this [LINK](https://t.me/Algorito_thebot).

## Description:
Algorito provides detailed explanations about any algorithm and guides you with code examples, algorithm recommendations based on your experience and preferences, and problem suggestions based on your Codeforces handle to improve your programming skills.

## Main Features:
- **Interaction with Gemini**: Leverage **Gemini's API**, which responds to your algorithm-related queries with specific commands. You can request algorithm descriptions, code templates in various languages, and recommendations for algorithms related to the topic you're learning. Gemini's answer varies based on the phase the user is in:
  - **0 <algorithm_name>**: Identifies the algorithm.
  - **1 <algorithm_name>**: Provides a brief description of the algorithm.
  - **2 <algorithm_name> <language>**: Shows a code template in the specified language.
  - **3 <interest_topic>**: Recommends a related algorithm.

- **Personalized Problem Recommendations**: Algorito also connects with the **Codeforces API**, allowing you to input your **handle** (username) and receive recommended problems. Algorito selects problems with a **rating higher than your current rating**, but **lower than your rating + 400**. This ensures you're always working on problems that match your level and are ones you haven't solved yet.

## How It Works:
1. **Learn Theory and Code**: If you have doubts about an algorithm, simply ask Algorito using the Gemini commands.
2. **Problem Recommendations**: Algorito knows your skill level based on your Codeforces history and offers problems suitable for your rating range, helping you improve with practical exercises.
3. **Intuitive Interaction**: With a simple and direct format, you can interact with Algorito using clear commands. Everything is managed through a friendly conversation on Telegram, making learning a dynamic experience.
